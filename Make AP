Chef is given two integers A and C such that A≤C.Chef wants to find whether there exists any integer B such that A,B, and C are in arithmetic progression.
Input Format The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two space-separated integers A and C,
the given integers.Output Format For each test case, output −1 if there exists no integer B such that A,B, and C are in arithmetic progression. Else, output the value
of B.



t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    a,b=map(int,input().split())
    if (a+b)%2==0:
        print(int(a+b)//2)
    else:
        print('-1')
