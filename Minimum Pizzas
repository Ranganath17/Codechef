Each pizza consists of 4 slices. There are N friends and each friend needs exactly X slices. Find the minimum number of pizzas they should order to satisfy their 
appetite.


t= int(input())
for i in range (t):
    n,x=map(int,input().split())
    pizza = n * x // 4
    if n*x % 4==0:
        print(pizza)
    else:
        print(pizza+1)
